Nothing incredibly complex about this program.
It's a very generic text editor, It only opens and saves .txt documents.
In this folder is a Test Document you can use to test the opening and saving functions.
When you start the program you can either click on the center of the window to start typing
or you can go up to the top bar where it says "File".
It's a button that opens up a list of options for either creating a new file, saving a current one
or opening a different file.

Heck you can even use this file as a test file.
